     "GTML is a simple yet powerful HTML pre-processor, which has a lot of
      features to design AND maintain entire web sites. It's syntax is very
      close to the C language preprocessor one. Some of its features are: use
      of macros, conditionnal processing, file inclusion, sitemap generation
      and much more. It is written in perl.">

<p>I would like to thank some people who helped, and contributed in the
development of <code>GTML</code>. 

<p>First of all I'd like to thank Gihan Perera, who is the initial author of
<code>GTML</code>, and who did a really great job, and who authorized me to take over
<code>GTML</code> since it seems he does not have time to enhance it, and a more
important thing, authorized me to distribute it under the GPL terms. <b>He</b>
is the guy to thanks, the real author of <code>GTML</code>.

<p>Then I would like to thank people who helped me correct, or enhance
<code>GTML</code>:
<ul>
  <li>Magog, helped me fixed a bug on directory creation, sent me Swedish
      support, and helped me grow my TODO list ;-) ; 
  <li>Philippe Marquet (aka PhM), gave me a very impressive list of features
      to add, with some advices on how to do it. Almost all of what he asked has
      been added, so far, as least makefile support, and sitemap
      generation. He also sent me some of bug reports.
  <li>Jens Bloch Helmers, sent me Norwegian support, a bug report on filename
      aliases, and an idea for my TODO list ;  
  <li>Simone Piunno (aka Pioppo), sent me Italian support ;
  <li>Gert-Jan Brink, sent me Dutch support ;
  <li>Uwe Arzt, sent me German support, as well as the base of sitemap generation
      code ; 
  <li>Harald Drangmeister, sent me bug reports, and asked me about the
      TITLE_CURRENT macro ;
  <li>Michael M Slusarz, sent me a patch to add embedded Perl code, which
      gave me the idea of the embedded system command ;
  <li>Wim Niemans Ri, sent me a lot of features that he added to his own <code>GTML</code>,
      from <m>#define+</m> to extensions selections ideas, via warning and
      error reports ;
  <li>Ken Guest, asked me for the <m>$ddth</m> feature in timestamps, sent me
      irish support, asked me about a better report <em>verbosity</em>
      control, and corrected english in the web pages (which was a
      <strong>great</strong> idea, hope I did not introduce too new mistakes
      since :) ; 
  <li>Andrew Greig, sent me the weekday patch, and corrected the <m>$ddth</m>
      english computation ;  
  <li>Bob Ham, sent me bug report about warning report format ;
  <li>Frank Boehme, sent me bug report about compression.
</ul>

<p>I hope I forgot nobody.

<p>Do not hesitate to correct me if needed, and to send bug reports, or documentation
mistakes (from typo errors, to bad English construction) reports.
